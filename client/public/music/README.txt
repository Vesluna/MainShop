MUSIC FILES PLACEMENT

The application is looking for the following music files:
1. toby-fox-shop-theme.mp3 - Toby Fox's "Shop Theme" from Undertale
2. wii-shop-remix.mp3 - "Wii Shop Channel Remix"

For copyright reasons, these files are not included in the repository. 
To use the music feature:

1. Obtain the music files legally (purchase, create your own version, or use royalty-free alternatives)
2. Place them in this directory (/public/music/) with the exact filenames mentioned above
3. Restart the application

Note on Copyright:
- Using copyrighted music without proper licensing may violate copyright laws
- Consider using royalty-free alternatives for public deployment
- This feature is primarily intended for personal/educational use

The music player will still display without the files, but will not be able to play music
until the files are added.
